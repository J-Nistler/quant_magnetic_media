The lingering question of resources was more around acquiring adequate digital storage to digitize the remaining ~50% of unique items. As long as that question is solved in a timely manner (within the n ext 5 years), given the favorable storage conditions, generous student staffing and general committment to preservation, I would have 99-100% confidence that the department will digitize all its unique magnetic media before it becomes unplayable (but it might intentionally allow non-unique portions of the collection to languish).",Above Average,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to play back most of our tapes hasn't yet gone away or gotten prohibitively expensive, even though I would have guessed several years ago that by 2018 we wouldn't be able to play back many formats. However, I still do feel that a great deal of our videotape collection, in the end, will never be digitized. Maybe 50 percent will be lost? Perhaps even more? What is going to be lost will be items that will become deemed of marginal value compared to the expense of digitization - such as items that are poorly shot, have questionable provenance, are ""orphan"" productions, are poorly labeled, and items that remain undiscovered because they are not cataloged in detail or because researchers have not requested access to them. I foresee that many production elements (b-roll, raw interviews, and edit versions) will also be lost because we will consider the final production the most valuable item to save when decisions have to be made about about where to expend resources.
